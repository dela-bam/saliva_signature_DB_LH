# Towards a unified framework for the analysis of saliva samples by sequencing

## Abstract
#### Background:
Oral microbiota (OM), defined as the broad range of microorganisms present in the oral cavity, plays a role in both oral and general health. However, its complexity has been always a challenge over the years not only due to the intrinsic complexity of the microbial community but also due to the diverse niches in the oral cavity, which provide various conditions for various microorganisms. Previous data suggested that the saliva microbiome, bathing different oral surfaces, can be an efficient representative of total OM. 

#### Aims:  
To simplify OM complex composition and retain its variability, we aimed to investigate the clustering (“enterosignatures”) approach on freely available saliva metagenomes. 

#### Materials & Methods: 
Seven datasets comprising a total of 814 saliva samples were retrieved from GenBank. Quality control, adaptor trimming, human DNA removal and taxonomic annotation were performed using the StaG metagenomic workflow. The annotated data from healthy control subjects was submitted to a non-negative matrix factorization algorithm as a practical approach for signature discovery. The obtained signatures were also applied to various disease states to assess alterations. 

#### Results: 
The model application resulted in 6 signatures for the healthy dataset. Each signature is composed of several genera with different weights, while each sample is a combination of these signatures. Four signatures are typically required to describe OM composition of the samples, with one signature typically being dominant. Moreover, alteration in the proportion of the present signatures in case of any systemic complication was also observed.  

#### Conclusions: 
This approach suggests potential to identify typical OM composition. However, due to unavailable clinical and demographic data, their effect on OM composition could not be evaluated. Therefore, further investigation is required to designate healthy oral/saliva signatures and evaluate its applicability in bridging the gap between oral and general heath.
